#### Description
This repositoy is for my CS50 final project.
The project is a real-time chat application built using React, Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to join chat rooms, exchange messages in real-time, and interact with other users.


1. User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out of the application. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions.

2. Chat Rooms: Users can join different chat rooms based on their own information.

3. Real-time Communication: The application utilizes Socket.IO, a real-time communication library, to enable instant messaging between users. Messages are sent and received in real-time, providing a seamless chatting experience.

4. User Presence: The application displays the list of users currently present in each chat room. Users can see who else is online and actively participating in the conversation.


Technologies Used:

Frontend: React, Redux, Socket.IO Client, HTML, CSS/SCSS <br />
Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, JWT <br />
Database: MySQL, Sequelize <br />


This project demonstrates the use of React, Node.js, and Socket.IO to build a real-time chat application. It can be further enhanced by adding additional features such as file sharing, emoji support, or message encryption.
